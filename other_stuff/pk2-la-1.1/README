PK2-LA: Logic Analyzer and I/O Probe for the Microchip PICkit2 programmer (v1.1)
================================================================================

Requirements:
================================================================================

python built with threading support
pyusb
>=pygtk-2.0

Getting Started:
================================================================================

Simply run pk2-la to start the analyzer. You must have your PICkit2 plugged in
at startup.

Logic Analzyer:
=================================================================================
A source should be attached to Pin 2 of the PICkit2 in order to use this 
component, if not, logic high values cannot be detected! It is recommended that
you also connect Pin 3 to ground.

The logic analzyer has three channels which can be used to collect data. This
data is then displayed in the window at the top of the screen. This data may
be saved as either a text representation or a png file. The data itself can be
captured under a number of different circumstances by adjusting the trigger
values.

Note: Only the visible area will be saved to the png.

I/O Probe:
================================================================================
A 2.5v to 5.0v source *must* be attached to Pin 2 of the PICkit2 in order to
use this component. It is recommended that you also connect Pin 3 to ground.

Select the initial conditions for the probe, including the directionality of
the pins. Once you are satisfied with the settings, press the "Enable I/O"
button to begin using the probe. Press it again to stop. While the probe is
running, the current state of the pins will be shown in the blue (input) and
red (output) boxes on the right of the window. Clicking on an output box
will change the state of the pin.

Note: Pin 1 can only be used as an output pin. This is a hardare limitation.
