_PIC programmer framework for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICKit[PICKit2],
especially for programming the f1-series PIC MIcrocontrollers with
http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/8bit/architecture/enhancedmidrange.html[Enhanced
Mid-Range Core] (eg. PIC12F1822) and possible more..._

This software is in an early stage, but at this time it can program PIC12F1822
and PIC16F1825 microcontrollers with any .hex file from command line.  It
contains also a big PICKit2 control framework written in ruby and usb-capture
dissassembler toolkit for reverse engineering the programming of other chips.

How to run/test/use
-------------------
* http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/[Install Ruby.]
* https://github.com/larskanis/libusb[Install libusb gem.]
* Note the
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/piklab/index.php?title=USB_Port_Problems[usb
rights issue]..
* Connect a PIC12F1822 device to the programmer and type:
----
cd test; ruby test_programming.rb blink.hex
----
There is a little example in the 'test' directory which writes a 'hello world'
program into the chip. The only thing that the 'hello world' does is it
switches the RA2 pin on. The other test file blinks the led connected to RA2,
it is called blink.hex.
(There is a test program for the 14-pin model PIC16F1825 too.)
The command
----
ruby on.rb
----
switches the device power on,
----
ruby off.rb
----
switches the power off. Voltage is 3.3V

You can replace the example hex file with any other
one.  http://gputils.sourceforge.net/[Gputils] can compile assembly source for
that f1-series chips.  Feature for other chips can be also implemented. Check
out the file test/lib/pic14_f1_device_datas.rb Implementing new chips and its'
parameters is quite simple. Note that LF chips cannot be bulk-erased in LVP
mode. The programming protocol can be different as well.. There are tech sheets
in the docs folder. Soon I will continue the coding also but now as it is
usable, let me have fun with the hardware itself for a while ;)
