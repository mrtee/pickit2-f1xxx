The USB Rights Issue
====================

To avoid USB access/permission problems create the file named /etc/udev/rules.d/50-pickit2 with the following content:
----
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0033", GROUP="microchip", MODE="0660"
----
Also you should add your user to the "microchip" group to make this all work, so type:
----
sudo addgroup microchip # (for Arch and Gentoo Linux, it is "groupadd")
sudo gpasswd -a your_user_name microchip
----
Relogin and everything will be OK.
